<hr style="margin-top:3em">
<h3 style="margin-top:3em"><a name="overview">Overview</a></h3>
<p>All administrative tasks in efa are done inside the <i>Admin Mode</i>. In
    efa-Boathouse, press button <i>Admin Mode</i> to login as an admin. efa-Base
    always runs in Admin Mode - there you will find all options in the respective menus.
    Only <a href="#admins">administrators</a> with sufficient privileges have access
    to these functions.</p>
<p>The Admin Interface provides the following functionality:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Configuring of efa through the option <i>Configuration</i></li>
    <li>Creation and Opening of Projects and Logbooks</li>
    <li>Administration of Data</li>
    <li>Creation of Statistics and Statistics Settings</li>
    <li>Messages and Logfiles</li>
    <li>Backup and Restore</li>
    <li>Online Update</li>
    <li>Quit efa</li>
</ul>


<hr style="margin-top:3em">
<h3 style="margin-top:3em"><a name="language">Language &amp; Region</a></h3>
<p>You chose your language and may select some regional settings upon the first start
    of efa. Later you may change these settings in the tab
<i>Language &amp; Region</i> in the configuration dialog.</p>


<hr style="margin-top:3em">
<h3 style="margin-top:3em"><a name="datadir">User Data Directory</a></h3>
<p>Upon the first start of efa you chose a folder where efa will store all user data.
    Later you can change this folder in the configuration under <i>Common - Common</i>.<br>
<b>Note:</b> If you change this at a later time, efa will not copy any data into the new
folger. This you have to do yourself.</p>


<hr style="margin-top:3em">
<h3 style="margin-top:3em"><a name="gui">Graphical UI Settings</a></h3>
<p>In the configuration under <i>Common - Appearance</i> you can select a
Look &amp; Feel. Usually you will get the best results from <i>MetalLookAndFeel</i>.</p>
<p>Under <i>efa-Boathouse- Appearance</i> you can select some options to influence the appearance of
    efa-Boathouse.
    A larger <i>Font Size</i> can improve readability, but too large a fond size may - depending on
    your screen resolution - cut off some dialogs and introduce scroll bars. For a screen resolution
    of 1024x768 a maximum font size of 16 is recommended.<br>
    You can also select a club logo here to be displayed in efa's main window.</p>
<p>If your efa windows hide some GUI elements of your operating systems like a menu bar, you can
    switch into <i>Expert Mode</i> and under <i>Common - Appearance</i> configure the maximum
    screen resolution to be used by efa, as well as its <i>Offset</i> (upper left corner).</p>
<p>The display of weather conditions, sunrise and sunset, and the clock can be configured under
    <i>efa-Boathouse- Widgets</i>. For your location, please enter correct coordinates and
    locations under <i>Meteo-Astro-Widget</i>. Updating current weather data requires an internet
    connection.</p>



<hr style="margin-top:3em">
<h3 style="margin-top:3em"><a name="admins">Administrators</a></h3>
<p>Only administrators may perform administrative tasks in efa. Administrators
    identify themselves through a name and a password, and may have individual rights.
    The main administrator's name is always <i>admin</i>. He has absolute rights and
    is created upon first start of efa.</p>
<p>In the admin mode, the main administrator <i>admin</i> may create further administrators and grant them
    individual rights.</p>


<hr style="margin-top:3em">
<h3 style="margin-top:3em"><a name="projects">Projects and Logbooks</a></h3>
<p>All data of a club is held within a project. Normally, you should create exactly one project for one
    club.</p>
<p>As storage type for a project, you may chose between one of the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>local File System: All files reside on your local hard drive (or a network drive)</li>
    <li>efaRemote: The data reside on a different computer running efa</li>
    <li>SQl Database: The data are stored in an SQL database</li>
</ul>
<p>Please refer to the
    <a href="install_en.html">Installation Guide</a> for instructions on how to import data from efa 1.x.</p>
<p>In a project, you may create as many logbooks as you like. Each logbook has a unique name and
    a validity range. efa will only allow to enter sessions within the validity range of each logbook.</p>

<hr style="margin-top:3em">
<h3 style="margin-top:3em"><a name="data">Persons, Boats and Destinations</a></h3>
<p>Each project has exactly one person, boat, and destination list (as well as related data such
    as boat status, waters, etc.). This data may be entered manually, imported from efa 1.x, or
    at any time be imported from an external CSV or XML file. The import can import new data or update
    existing data. The format of the data to be imported has to follow certain rules, and must be indentical
    as the export format that efa generates. Therefore it is easiests to first generate an export of
    some dummy data and use the exported file as a template to create import files.</p>


<hr style="margin-top:3em">
<h3 style="margin-top:3em"><a name="statistics">Statistics Settings</a></h3>
<p>Statistics can at any point in time be created by an administrator with appropriate
    permissions by chosing the option <i>Statistics</i> and then select <i>One-Time Statistics</i>.
    In order to make statistics available to everyone in the club, you have to save them as
    <i>statistics setting</i> as a admin first, and enable the option <i>Statistic publicly available</i>.</p>


<hr style="margin-top:3em">
<h3 style="margin-top:3em"><a name="datasafety">Data Safety</a></h3>
<p>To protect against data loss in case of hardware failures, software failures or
    improper use, you should take some precautious actions:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Backups:
        <ul>
            <li>create manually: You can manually create a backup by chosing the menu option
        <i>Backups</i>. To be protected against hardware failures, these backups should be stored
        on an external device, such as an external hard drive or USB stick.</li>
            <li>create automatically: With efaCLI you can script an automatic createion of backups.
        <a href="http://efa.nmichael.de/efalive.html">efaLive</a> integrates efaCLI to automatically
        create backups at scheduled times, and even send them home to you via email.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Mirror Directory on second Hard Drive: In the configuration under
        <i>Data - local Files</i> you can configure a mirror directory. efa will then
        store all data in two locations - your primary efa data folder, and this mirror directory.
        To protect against hard disk failures, you should put this mirror directory either onto a
        secondary hard disk, or onto a USB stick which is always present.
    </li>
</ul>


<hr style="margin-top:3em">
<h3 style="margin-top:3em"><a name="remote">Remote Access</a></h3>
<p>With efa you can access a remote running efa, which is for example installed in your boathouse,
    from any place in the world over the internet - if also the computer in the boathouse is connected
    to the internet. This way you can for example administer efa remotely from home, or connect multiple
    efa installations to share the same data.</p>
<p>First you have to activate the remote access function in the server efa by enabling the corresponding
    option in the configuration under <i>Data - efaRemote</i>. To access a remote efa installation,
    you have to have efa installed on your client as well, and create a project there with storage type
    <i>efaRemote</i>. To connect to the server efa, you have to enter the server's IP address in your
    client project, and specify an administrator account on the server to login. This administrator must
    have the permission <i>Remote Access</i> on the server. You also have to specify the project name
    on the server you want to access.</p>
<p>Per default, efa uses port 3834 to connect remotely. If your server is standing
    behind a router, you have to enable <i>Port Forwarding</i> on your router for port 3834
    to your server PC.</p>
<p>If the server does not have a static IP address, you may use
    <a href="http://efa-online.nmichael.de">efaOnline</a> to get the current IP address of the#
    server when connecting from the client. Please sign up for an account on
<a href="http://efa-online.nmichael.de">efaOnline</a> and enter this account data both on the
server in the configuration settings, as well as on the client in the project settings.</p>
