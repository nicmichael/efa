<p><b>&quot;Version 1.x&quot;</b> refers to all <i>efa1</i> Versions up to
    Version 1.8.3, as well as the first <i>efa2</i> pre-released versions with the internal
    version number 1.9.0.</p>

<p><b>&quot;Version 2.x&quot;</b> refers to the <i>efa2</i> Beta Version efa2_beta (internal
    version number 1.9.9) as well as Version 2.0 and all following versions 2.x.</p>

<p>To find out about your current efa version, please click the efa logo in efa or select
    option <i>Info</i> from menu <i>Help</i>.</p>


<hr style="margin-top:3em">
<h3 style="margin-top:3em"><a name="install">Installation of this Version (Version 2.x)</a></h3>

<p>If you already use a previous version of efa (Version 1.x), install or unpack this version
    in a separate directory and follow the instructions in section
<a href="#upgrade">Migration from efa Version 1.x to Version 2.x</a>.</p>

<p>If this is your first efa installation, install or unpack into a new directory
and follow the instructions in section
<a href="#start">Getting started with efa</a>.</p>

<p>If you are updating an efa 2.x installation, please install or unpack this
    update into the same directory as your previous efa 2.x installation.
    <b>Caution:</b> This only applies if your previous version is a version 2.x
    (internal version number 1.9.9, 2.0 or newer)!</p>

<h4>Installation with Windows Setup Program</h4>

<p>If you have downloaded the Windows Installer for efa, please start the setup
    program and follow the steps through the installation.</p>

<h4>Installation of ZIP Archive</h4>

<p>If you have downloaded the ZIP archive, please create a directory for efa
    (like <tt>c:\Program Files\efa2</tt> on Windows or <tt>/opt/efa2</tt> on
Linux) and unpack the content of the ZIP archive into this directory.</p>


<hr style="margin-top:3em">
<h3 style="margin-top:3em"><a name="start">Getting started with efa</a></h3>

<h4>Starting efa</h4>

<p>efa comes in two different flavors depending on the intended use:</p>

<ol>
    <li>The <b>Boathouse Version</b> comes with a simplified user interface which is intended
for the use in a boathouse where all rowers enter their outings directly into
efa. All administrative tasks require an admin login with a password.</li>
    <li>The <b>Basis Version</b> starts up with an administrative user interface which allows
full access to all data and is intended for use by administrators or private
users.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you have used the Windows setup program it has automatically created entries
for starting efa in your Windows start menu.<p>

<p>Otherwise you can start efa by running the following batch files or shell
scrips:</p>
<table border>
    <tr><td>efaBase.sh</td><td>efa Base Version (Linux/UNIX)</td></tr>
    <tr><td>efaBase.bat</td><td>efa Base Version (Windows)</td></tr>
    <tr><td>efaBths.sh</td><td>efa Boathouse Version (Linux/UNIX)</td></tr>
    <tr><td>efaBths.bat</td><td>efa Boathouse Version (Windows)</td></tr>
    <tr><td>efaCLI.sh</td><td>efa Command Line Interface (Linux/UNIX)</td></tr>
    <tr><td>efaCLI.bat</td><td>efa Command Line Interface (Windows)</td></tr>
</table>

<h4>Start Problems</h4>

<p>If efa fails to start with a message <i>For security reasons efa won't start</i>,
    please delete in the home directory on your computer
(on Windows usually <tt>C:\Document &amp; Settings\<i>username</i></tt>,
on Linux/UNIX usually <tt>/home/<i>username</i></tt>) the file named
<tt>.efa_<i>installpath</i></tt>, where <i>installpath</i> is the location of
your efa installation.<br>
Example: If on Windows efa is installed at <tt>C:\Program Files\efa2</tt>,
please delete in <tt>C:\Document &amp; Settings\<i>username</i></tt> the
file <tt>.efa_CProgramFilesefa2</tt>.<br>
If on Linux efa is installed at <tt>/opt/efa2</tt>, please delete in
<tt>/home/<i>username</i></tt> the file named <tt>.efa_optefa2</tt>.<br>
<b>Caution:</b> If multiple version of efa are installed, many similar of these files
exist. Please be careful to delete the right one!</p>

<h4>Setting up efa</h4>

<p>In efa 2.x all data is organized in <i>Projects</i>. Usually you will just create one
    project for your club, which will contain all data.</p>

<p>To get started with efa 2.x, please create a new project in Admin Mode.
If you want to import data from efa 1.x, please follow the instrunctions in section
<a href="#upgrade">Migration from efa Version 1.x to Version 2.x</a>.</p>
<p>Else create a new, empty logbook after creating the project. Boats, Persons,
    and Destinations can either be entered manually, or be imported by the import
    functions in respective administration dialogs. The order of importing data may have
    to follow certain dependencies (for example, the status that a person may have must be
    imported or created before the persons are imported; waters have to be defined before
    destinations using these waters are imported etc.).
    <b>Note</b> This import function is <b>not</b> intended to import data of efa Version 1.x!</p>

<p>The main steps to setup and configure efa are described in
    <a href="configure_en.html">this document</a>.</p>


<hr style="margin-top:3em">
<h3 style="margin-top:3em"><a name="upgrade">Migration from efa Version 1.x to Version 2.x</a></h3>

<p>For an explanation of the version numbers, please see section <a href="#versions">Understanding
        the Version Numbers</a>.</p>

<h4>Prerequisits for Migration from Version 1.x to Version 2.x</h4>

<p>efa Version 2.x can only import data from the 1.x versions 1.8.3 and 1.9.0.
If you are using an older version than 1.8.3, please update to
<a href="http://efa.nmichael.de">version 1.8.3</a> first.</p>

<h4><a name="prepare_upgrade">Preparations in efa Version 1.x before Data Import into Version 2.x</a></h4>

<p>The following steps should be completed in Version 1.x <b>before the data import</b> into
    the new version:</p>

<ol>
    <li><b>Open all old data of Version 1.x in efa 1.8.3 (or 1.9.0)</b><br>
In order to convert all data, including old logbooks, member lists, boats etc., into
the format of Version 1.8.3 (or 1.9.0), they must at least once be <i>touched</i>
bz efa. To accomplish this, please create a statistic in efa 1.x with the option
<i>all logbooks</i> and no limitation on any dates.</li>
    <li><b>Document Installation Directory of efa 1.x</b><br>
Please write down the installation directory of your efa 1.x installation. You will
be asked for this when importing data into version 2.x.</li>
    <li><b>Cleanup and Documentation of Logbooks, Member Lists, etc.</b><br>
For importing data into version 2.0 it is important that the data is free of errors.<br>
Please open all logbnooks, one after another, and check whether all logbooks, as well
as boat lists, member lists, and destination lists are complete. Please write down for
all logbooks:<br>
<ul>
    <li>Name and Location of Logbook</li>
    <li>Name and Location of Member, Boot, and Destination Lists</li>
    <li>Links to previous and next Logbook</li>
</ul>
You can find this information under <i>Administration - Logbook - Settings for the logbook</i>, or in the
Boathouse Version in <i>Admin Mode - Full Logbook Access -
        Administration - Logbook - Settings for the logbook</i>.<br>
        The links to <i>previous Logbook</i> and
        <i>next Logbook</i> form a chain of logbooks, for example
        <i>2009 <-> 2010 <-> 2011</i>. Please ensure that this chain is correct and
        complete, for example: If logbook<i>2010</i> refers to <i>2009</i> as previous logbook,
        then logbook <i>2009</i> must also refer to <i>2010</i> as next loogbook etc.<br>
If you have test logbook or incomplete logbooks which you don't want to import, please
write down their names separately.</li>
    <li><b>Correct or Create Synonys in efa 1.x</b><br>
        In order for the import into efa 2.x to work correctly, please verify that in case of combined
        boats or persons whose names have changed a synonym has been defined.</li>
    <li><b>Timespan of Logbook</b><br>
In efa 1.x it sometimes happens that a session is entered with a wrong date, like 12.3.<b>2021</b>
instead of 12.3.<b>2011</b>. Such entries must be corrected prior to the import. You find those
    easiest if you create a statistic for the logbook <i>without</i> the option <i>all logbooks</i>
    (no limitation to any dates) and closely pay attention to the date of entries efa finds.</li>
    <li><b>efa in the Boat House</b><br>
        If you are using efa in the boat house, please finish all open sessions before starting
        the import.</li>
    <li><b>Create Statistics</b><br>
In order to verify whether all data has successfully been imported into version 2.x,
you should now create some statistics in efa 1.x, to be able to later compare them
with analogous statistics created in efa 2.x.</li>
    <li><b>Data Backup</b><br>
efa 2.x does not modify or delete any data of version 1.x. But to be protected
against errors and erroneous operation, you should perform a backup of all your
efa 1.x data and save it on an external medium like a memory stick.<br>
If you have been storing all data in the <tt>data</tt> folder of efa (see above),
it is sufficient to copy that folder.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Install efa Version 2.x</h4>
<p>Install or unpack efa 2.x into a new, empty directory, as described in section
    <a href="#install">Installation of this Version (Version 2.x)</a></p>

<h4>Preparation in Version 2.x before starting the Import</h4>
<p>If you have defined custom types for session or boat types in efa 1.x, then these must be
    defined in efa 2.x <b>before</b> starting the import. In this case, please open the efa
    configuration, activate the <i>Expert Mode</i>, and add these types in the corresponding
    categories unter <i>Types</i> by clicking on the plus symbol. As a name (appears in red on
    the left side) you must enter the <b>exact same</b> name as in efa 1.x (same spelling).</p>

<h4>Importing efa 1.x Data into Version 2.x</h4>
<p>After installing efa 2.x, starte the new version as described in <a href="#start">Getting started with efa</a>
    and create a new project. After the last step of project creation, you will be
    asked whether you want to import data from Version 1.x. Please select this option.<br>
<b>Node:</b> This is the only opportunity to import data from version 1.x. Importing data
at a later point in time is not possible!</p>

<p>The first steop of the import dialog will ask you to select the
    location of your efa 1.x installation, which you have written down before.</p>

<p>efa now searches the selected efa 1.x installation for data and presents you with
    a selection of data to import. Select all data you want to import (normally all data),
    and specify names and time ranges for logbooks.<br>
<b>Caution</b>: efa2 only allows sessions to be added to logbooks within the configured time ranges.
All imported sessions must be within the specified range for the logbook (see step
<a href="#prepare_upgrade">Preprarations</a>).</p>

<p>During import a logfile will be created, which also contains warnings and errors that might
    have occurred. If you experience a lot of errors, please delete the project again and
    try to fix those errors in efa 1.x first, then inport the data again. If only a few
    errors occur, you  may as well fix them in efa 2.x If you need help to figure out what
    the errors are about and how to fix them, please consult the
<a href="http://forum.nmichael.de">Support Forum</a>.</p>

<p>After the import, thoroughly validate your data for correctness
    (for example by comparing statistics from version 2.x with previous statistics from version 1.x),
    and start your productive use of efa 2.x only when your certain that all data is correct..</p>

<p>Limitations of the Import:</p>
<ul>
    <li>not being imported:
        <ul>
            <li>Configuration, Administrators, Types</li>
            <li>Messages and Logfiles</li>
            <li>Statistic Settings</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>not correctly being imported:
        <ul>
            <li>Boat Status for Boats on the Water (therefore finish sessions first!)</li>
            <li>Waters for Multi-Day Journeys (are lost)</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Data should be verified carefully if you have been using:
        <ul>
            <li>Synonyms</li>
            <li>Combo Boats</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>A frequent reason for versioning conflicts during the import are
        logbooks which have the same starting validity date</li>
</ul>
